# Plans API

## Common provisions

#### Terminology

The terminology of [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) (specifically __must__, __should__, __may__ and their negatives) applies.  The word __will__, when applied to the Plans API ("the API"), has the same meaning as __must__.

#### Protocol

The API supports communication over HTTPS only.

#### Encoding

The API supports communication using JSON encoding only.  The client __must__ submit the headers `Content-Type: application/json` and `Accept: application/json` for all requests.  Failure to do so __will__ result in a `415 Unsupported Media Type` response.  The API __will__ include the header `Content-Type: application/json` with its response.

#### Authentication

Unless otherwise specified, the endpoints in the API are authenticated by a JWT bearer token.  One token source are accepted:

* Tokens generated by Amazon Cognito and acquired as part of authentication to the Users Service;

The client __must__ submit the header `Authorization: <JWT>` with all requests. Failure to do so, or submitting an invalid or expired JWT, __will__ result in a `401 Unauthorized` response.  

#### General responses

In addition to the AWS API Gateway responses and the specific responses for each endpoint, the server __may__ respond with one of the following HTTP responses:

* `400 Bad Request` with `Status` header equal to `InvalidSchema`, if the JSON body of the request does not match the requirements of the endpoint.
* `403 Forbidden` with `Status` header equal to `Forbidden`, if the user is not allowed to perform the requested action.
* `404 Unknown` with `Status` header equal to `UnknownEndpoint`, if an invalid endpoint was requested.

## Schema

### Simple

The following simple types __may__ be used in responses:

* `string`, `number`: as defined in the [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org) standard.
* `Uuid`: a `string` matching the regular expression `^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$`, that is, the string representation of an [RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) UUID.
* `Datetime`: a `string` matching the regular expression `/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}(Z|+\d{2}:\d{2})/` and representing a date and time in full [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format.

## Endpoints

### Daily Readiness

#### Create

This endpoint can be called to register a new daily readiness survey.

##### Query String
 
The client __must__ submit a request to the endpoint `/plans/version/daily_readiness`. The request method __must__ be `POST`.

##### Request

The client __must__ submit a request body containing a JSON object with the following schema:
```
{
    "date_time": Datetime,
    "user_id": Uuid,
    "soreness": [sore_part, sore_part],

* `soreness` __should__ reflect the number of body part that the user indicated soreness that were not candidates for clearance. Length __could__ be 0.
* `clear_candidates` __should__ include body parts that were candidates to be cleared of historical status. Note this should include the body part even if marked "all_clear".
* `sleep_quality` __should__ be an integer between 1 and 10 or null
* `readiness` __should__ be an integer between 1 and 10 or null
* `wants_functional_strength` is optional argument only for the users that are eligible for functional strength and should be included once they are eligible
* `current_sport_name` __should__ be integer representing SportName enumeration
* `current_position` __should__ be integer representating position enumeration for specific sport or StrengthConditioningType enumeration
* `sessions` __should__ be a list of session, where each session matches the body of [Create](#create-2) Session.
* `sleep_data` __should__ be a list of sleep_events.
* `sessions_planned` __should__ be a boolean representing whether the user plans to train again that day.
* `health_sync_date` is __optional__ and only provided if one of the sessions is obtained from health app
* `sore_part` __should__ have the following schema:
```
{
    "body_part": number,
    "severity": number,
    "side": number,
    "pain": boolean,
    "status": string
}
```
* `body_part` __should__ be an integer reflecting BodyPart enum
* `severity` __should__ be an integer between 0 and 5. (0 is only allowed for clear_candidates)
* `side` __should__ be an integer between 0 and 2
* `pain` __should__ be a boolean to indicate whether it's pain or soreness.
* `status` __should__ be a string representating the historical soreness status if one was received. Optional for soreness but required for clear candidates.

Note: `current_sport_name` and `current_position` are only required when the user is first eligible for functional strength. `current_position` should always be present. `current_sport` is optional and if it's absent, StrengthConditioningType is assumed for `current_position`.
