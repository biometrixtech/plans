# Plans API

## Common provisions

#### Terminology

The terminology of [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) (specifically __must__, __should__, __may__ and their negatives) applies.  The word __will__, when applied to the Plans API ("the API"), has the same meaning as __must__.

#### Protocol

The API supports communication over HTTPS only.

#### Encoding

The API supports communication using JSON encoding only.  The client __must__ submit the headers `Content-Type: application/json` and `Accept: application/json` for all requests.  Failure to do so __will__ result in a `415 Unsupported Media Type` response.  The API __will__ include the header `Content-Type: application/json` with its response.

#### Authentication

Unless otherwise specified, the endpoints in the API are authenticated by a JWT bearer token.  Two token sources are accepted:

* Tokens generated by AWS Cognito and acquired as part of authentication to the Users Service;
* Tokens generated by third party clients using an agreed upon definition with Fathom and based on a public/private key pair

The client __must__ submit the header `Authorization: <JWT>` with all requests. Failure to do so, or submitting an invalid or expired JWT, __will__ result in a `401 Unauthorized` response.  

#### General responses

In addition to the AWS API Gateway responses and the specific responses for each endpoint, the server __may__ respond with one of the following HTTP responses:

* `400 Bad Request` with `Status` header equal to `InvalidSchema`, if the JSON body of the request does not match the requirements of the endpoint.
* `403 Forbidden` with `Status` header equal to `Forbidden`, if the user is not allowed to perform the requested action.
* `404 Unknown` with `Status` header equal to `UnknownEndpoint`, if an invalid endpoint was requested.

## Schema

### Simple

The following simple types __may__ be used in responses:

* `string`, `number`: as defined in the [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org) standard.
* `Uuid`: a `string` matching the regular expression `^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$`, that is, the string representation of an [RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) UUID.
* `Datetime`: a `string` matching the regular expression `/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}(Z|+\d{2}:\d{2})/` and representing a date and time in full [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format.

## Overview

The plans service generates a Daily Plan for a user based on one or both of the following pathways:

* Daily Readiness Survey - information about the user's "readiness" and pain/soreness for a given day
* Post-Session Survey - information about a user's workout session

As this information is gathered over time, historical patterns in soreness and workouts will influence Daily Plan creation.

### Daily Readiness Survey

##### Required Data Elements

The following data elements are required when following the Daily Readiness pathway to Daily Plan generation.

* `date_time` __should__ reflect the local time that survey was taken
* `soreness` __should__ reflect a list of body parts(`sore_part`) with pain or soreness. Length __could__ be 0.

`sore_part` __should__ include the following:

* `body_part` __should__ be an integer reflecting BodyPart enum of the body part with pain/soreness
* `severity` __should__ be an integer 0, 1, 3 or 5 indicating the severity of the pain/soreness
* `movement` __should__ be an integer 0, 1, 3 or 5 indicating how much movement is restricted 
* `side` __should__ be an integer, either 0 (both sides/non-bilateral), 1 (left) or 2 (right)
* `pain` __should__ be a boolean to indicate whether it's pain or soreness.

Note: Fathom can customize the processing of `severity` and `movement` data upon request to accommodate third-party systems that only report `severity` related measures.

##### Optional Data Elements

The following data elements are not required to generate a plan using the Daily Readiness survey pathway, but enhance the customization of the plan for the user.

* `sleep_quality` __should__ be an integer between 1 and 10 or null
* `readiness` __should__ be an integer between 1 and 10 or null
* `sessions` __should__ be a list of workout sessions.
* `sleep_data` __should__ be a list of sleep_events.
* `sessions_planned` __should__ be a boolean representing whether the user plans to train again that day.
* `health_sync_date` is __optional__ and only provided if one of the sessions is obtained from health app

`session` __should__ include the following:
* `event_date` __should__ reflect the date and time when the survey about the session happened
* `RPE` __should__ be an integer between 1 and 10 indicating the Rate of Perceived Exertion of the athlete during the session
* `sport_name` __should__ be an integer that reflects Fathom's sport enumerations
* `duration` __should__ be an integer that reflects length of the workout session in minutes
* `description` __should__ be an string that the user enters to identify this session
* `soreness` __should__ follow the same definition as in Daily Readiness

`sleep_event` __should__ include the following:

* `value` __should__ be a string indicating "INBED"
* `start_date` __should__ indicate the date/time start of sleep
* `end_date` __should__ indicate the date/time end of sleep


### Post-Session Survey


* `event_date` __should__ reflect the date and time when the survey is submitted.
* `health_sync_date` is __optional__ and only provided if one of the sessions is obtained from health app
* `session` __should__ be of the following schema
* `sessions_planned` __should__ be a boolean representing whether the user plans to train again that day.
